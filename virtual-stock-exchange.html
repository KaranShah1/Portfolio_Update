                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>Participated in a virtual stock exchange simulation using MarketWatch, achieving the #1 ranking with an impressive 19.90% return through strategic ETF investments and R-based financial analysis.</p>

                    <h2>My Portfolio & Strategy</h2>

                    <div class="strategy-section">
                        <h4>1. XLK Holdings:</h4>
                        <p>â€¢ 1,275 shares (100% of my portfolio), valued at $236,563.50, with a 12.87% gain in value. XLK performed exceptionally well, which supported my decision to concentrate most of my funds in this ETF.</p>
                        <p>My analysis originally recommended purchasing 1,208 shares, but due to financial constraints, I was able to buy 1,148 shares. As profits grew between October 30th and November 10th, I bought an additional 82 shares, ultimately surpassing my initial goal by purchasing a total of 1,275 shares.</p>
                        
                        <h4>2. Riskier Strategy:</h4>
                        <p>While diversification is a fundamental principle of risk management, I chose a concentrated investment strategy. Although this heightened my risk exposure, I was able to manage it by continuously monitoring XLK's performance and adjusting my holdings based on market data.</p>

This indicates strong and profitable performance for my chosen ETFs, particularly in the technology sector (XLK).</p>

                        <p>I learned how to analyze specific sectors (technology, healthcare, finance) and identify those with the strongest growth potential. The technology sector, represented by XLK, outperformed during this period, validating my strategy of concentrating my investments in this area.</p>
                        
                        <h4>4. Portfolio Optimization using R:</h4>
                        <p>R was instrumental in performing time-series analysis, regression, and portfolio optimization. I built models to predict ETF performance, calculate risk metrics, and optimize my portfolio based on historical data.</p>
